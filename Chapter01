1p1. express the result of the double-slit experiment in Dirac notation.

    Let constant s represent something at the source,
    constant 0 represent something at the first slit, constant 1 represent something at the second slit
    and each real number x represent the position along the measurement wall.
    The amplitude from the source to the first slit is <0|s>, and for each real number x the amplitude from that slit to x is <x|0>.
    Likewise for the other slit.
    The amplitude from the source to x is the sum over slits 'n' of <x|n> * <n|s>, for n in {0,1}.
    Suppose the distance between the slits is 2d, locate slit n at
    a position perpendicular to x = (2n-1)*d and suppose
    <x|n> is a complex amplitude that diminishes normally with x_n = | x - (2n-1)*d |
    and which has a phase
    exp(i * frequency * distance traveled)
    where the distance traveled depends on the distance from the slits to x, as sqrt((x_n)**2 + y**2),
    where y is the perpendicular distance from the plane of the slits to the plane of the observations.
    The width of the normal distribution may exceed 90 degrees. E.g.
    https://courses.lumenlearning.com/austincc-physics2/chapter/27-5-single-slit-diffraction/
    reports that self-interference produces a visible central maximum of width 41;
    "the second maximum is only about half as wide as the central maximum," and many maxima
    are visible. Two dim maxima on each side would indicate that light is
    significantly difracted over 41*3 degrees.
    "the central maximum extends 20.7º on either side of the original beam, for a width of about 41º."
    The absolute values of the amplitudes <x|0> and <x|1> are close, if d << y.
    The phases of those amplitudes are quite different, if the frequency f is
    high enough that 1/f < |d(x, 0) - d(x, 1)|,
    since the phase coming from each slit changes completely when it traverses a distance
    equal to the wavelength.
    Symmetry in the experimental setup makes <1|s> = <0|s>.
    The amplitude from source to x is a constant times a normal distribution times
    exp(i * frequency * sqrt(y**2 + (x - d)**2)) + exp(i * frequency * sqrt(y**2 + (x + d)**2))
    I suppose we can calculate that the result is periodic in x.¨

1p2. express the result in Dirac notation of the version of the experiment in which single particles are sent one at a time through the system.

    This equation still holds:
    <x|s> = <x|0> * <0|s> + <x|1> * <1|s>
    Now the source is a single particle released. Presumably,
    <0|s> and <1|s> are constant and equal.
    Similarly, <x|0> and <x|1> have the same equation, I guess.
    Why would the absolute value of the amplitude vary normally with x.

1p3. ... and a decision is made to monitor the particle ...

    In this case, if the particle is observed to reach one of the slits, then
    <1|s> and <0|s> have the values 0 and 1, or 1 and 0.
    The particle then spreads out normally.

    Its phase is lost in measurement, as
    the probability distribution of where the particle reaches the measurement screen vs x
    measures the amplitude * its own complex conjugate.
    This spread is as surprising to me as the two-slit experiment :-)
    As a physics nube, I find the diffraction of particles just as weird as passing through 2 slits.
    Huygens principle: "the waveform is created from every point on the wavefront."

1p4. How do these results differ?

    Particles passing through slits diffract and spread out perpendicular to the slit.
    When a particle passes through two slits, interference patterns are observed.

2p1. Investigate the Stern-Gerlach experiment of 1921.
What was the expectation from classical theory for the outcome and what actually occurred?

    Stern-Gerlach is mentioned on page 50 of Hidary.
    Electrons deflected by a magnetic field could have their own
    magnetic dipole oriented with any angle alpha relative to the system.
        Indeed, we might imagine electron spin orientation to randomly walk on the surface of a sphere.
        This is done when computing the orientation of a protein such as the anosin-myosin bond;
        An event sets all the spins to the same direction, after which they wander randomly on the sphere.

        "The simplest model for a two spin molecule undergoing rotational diffusion is the
        random isotropic walk of the internuclear vector on a sphere",
            The Dipolar InteractionUnder All Angles, GUY LIPPENS, JEAN JEENER.

    "Rotational diffusion" certainly suggests magnetic dipoles!

    If the particles were classical spinning objects, one would expect
    the distribution of their spin angular momentum vectors to be random and continuous.
    Each particle would be deflected by an amount proportional to the dot product of its 
    magnetic moment with the external field gradient, producing some density distribution 
    on the detector screen. Instead, the particles passing through the 
    Stern–Gerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount. 
    This was a measurement of the quantum observable now known as spin angular momentum, 
    which demonstrated possible outcomes of a measurement where 
    the observable has a discrete set of values or point spectrum.

    Years after the experiment, it turned out that what was being measured 
    was intrinsic angular momentum, not orbital angular momentum.
    Silver, it turns out, has orbital angular momentum 0.
    Electrons are spin-1⁄2 particles. These have only two possible 
    spin angular momentum values measured along any axis,
    h-bar /2 and negative h-bar /2,
    a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon.
    Because its value is always the same, it is regarded as 
    an intrinsic property of electrons, and
    is sometimes known as "intrinsic angular momentum"
    (to distinguish it from orbital angular momentum, which can vary and depends on the presence of other particles).


2p2. Here is the postcard that X sent to Y after the experiment. Interpret the results.

    https://faculty.chemistry.harvard.edu/files/dudley-herschbach/files/how_a_bad_cigar_0.pdf?m=1363959307
    
    "According to the Bohr model, the space quantization should be only twofold... 
    which made feasible a decisive test of spatial quantization 
    using magnetic deflection of an atomic beam... the two oppositely oriented components 
    should be defleccted outside the width of the original beam. 
    Classical mechanics, in contrast predicted thhat the atomic magnets would precess 
    in the field but remain randomly oriented, so the 
    deflections would only broaden but not split the beam."
    
    One would expect a beam with its peak in the center, due to atoms with spin perpendicular to the machine. 
    Instead, there particles landed on the detector in a ring, 
    leaving a hole where the peak might have been. 
    The particles had been defleccted outside the width of the original beam.

    Stern and Gerlach produced strong evidence of
    real spatial quantization as Bohr advocated in his model of the atom, 
    vs a classical model. 

2p3. Express the results of the SG experiment in Dirac notation.

    wiki:
    In mathematical terms, the initial state of the particles is
    |ψ⟩ =c_1 times |ψ j= +ℏ/2⟩ + c_2|ψ j= -ℏ/2⟩
    where constants c_1 and c_2 are complex numbers.
    This initial state spin can point in any direction. The squares of the absolute values
    |c_1|^2 and |c_2|^2
    determine the probabilities that for a system in the initial state
    |ψ⟩ one of the two possible values of j is found after the measurement is made.
    The constants c_1 and c_2 must also be normalized in order that the probability
    of finding either one of the values be unity. So c_1 and c_2 have four degrees of freedom, R^4,
    subject to one constraint, so that c_1 and c_2 describe some real (w,x,y,z) on the 4-sphere.
        This doesn't determine the constants, because they are complex numbers.
    Therefore, the measurement yields only the squared magnitudes of the constants,
    which are interpreted as probabilities.

3p1. Given the Landauer bound of kTln2: compute the dissipation of energy in a system where there are five erasures of bits.

    n=5.
    k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38064852 × 10-23 Joules / K
    T = temperature = 300 Kelvin,
    ln2 = 0.7
    their product = 1,435 * 10^-20 Joules.

4p1. Is every state represented in a Hilbert space a superposition of other states?

    Yes. change basis.

5p1. Born's rule tells us that the square of the modulus of the amplitude of a state gives 
us the probability of observing that outcome upon measurement. Why?

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule
    says:
    if an observable corresponding to a self-adjoint operator A
    with discrete spectrum
    is measured in a system
    with normalized wave function |ψ⟩
    the measured result will be one of the eigenvalues of A.
    As to why, wiki suggests: "Derivation from more basic principles":

    Gleason's theorem shows that the Born rule can be derived
    from the usual mathematical representation of measurements in quantum physics
    together with the assumption of non-contextuality.
    Andrew M. Gleason first proved the theorem in 1957...
    ... theorem was historically significant for the role it played in
    showing that wide classes of hidden-variable theories are inconsistent
    with quantum physics.

    Andrew Gleason, Measures on the Closed Subspaces of a Hilbert Space, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 6 No. 4 (1957), 885–893
    (which I cannot yet digest nor relate to QC)
    But the answer as to "why" may be "measure theory of Hilbert spaces."

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics#%22Observables%22_as_self-adjoint_operators

    The eigenvectors of a von Neumann observable form an 
    orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space, and each possible 
    outcome of that measurement corresponds to one of the 
    eigenvectors = vectors comprising the basis. 
    A density operator is a positive-semidefinite operator on 
    the Hilbert space whose trace is equal to 1.[1][2] 
    For each measurement that can be defined, the probability 
    distribution over the outcomes of that measurement can be 
    computed from the density operator. 
    The procedure for doing so is the Born rule...

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule

    if an observable corresponding to a self-adjoint operator A 
    with eigenvalue lambda corresponding to eigenspace E
    is measured in a system with normalized wave function |psi>
    then let P_E be the projectoin of the Hilbert space onto E,
    and:
    the probability of measuring the eigenvalue lambda
    will equal <phi|P_E|phi> which indicates why the probability
    is the square of the modulus of the amplitude. 

    Suppose E is spanned by a single vector, v. 
    Represent phi and P_E in the same basis, so that P_E is 
    a diagonal matrix which is 
    zero except at column v and row v. This could be written
    as the tensor product of (0...,0,1,0...0) with itself, 
    the 1 occurring at basis vector v. Represent phi in this
    basis and supppose the coefficient of v in phi is the 
    complex coefficient c. Then as <phi| is the conjugate
    transpose of |phi> 

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_transpose

    then <phi|P_E|phi> is the conjugate of c times c itself and
    the probability of measuring tthe eigenvalue lambda is:
    |c|^2.

    So, another answer to "why" is: "because <phi| is not the     
    transpose of |phi> , but the conjugate transpose."
    

6p1. What does non-separable mean for two states, and what does that tell us about these states?

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_state

    If a pure state in a composite system can be written as
    the tensor product of pure states in the component systems,
    it is said to be separable. Otherwise it is called entangled.

    Consider the qubits (a,b) and (c,d) The tensor product 
    (ac, ad)
    (bc, bd)
    or (ac,ad,bc,bd)
    is separable. 

    The state is separable just in case 
    the descriminant of the matrix is zero. 

    E.g. 
    (1,2)
    (3,6)
    is separable, and 

    (1,0)
    (0,1)
    written in dirac notation as |00> + |11> is not.
