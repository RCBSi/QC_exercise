Hidary Chapter 2:

1. Do the following physical systems satisfy DiVincenzo's criteria?
1a. A set of five trapped ion qubits
that can be initialized to the |0> state and
measured in the Z basis with the ability to implement
arbitrary single qubit rotations.

    1a1+. "five" is precise; in the ion qubit model
    the qubits are lined up in a row, and scaling up to
    more atoms in the row seems theoretically possible.
    1a2+ the |0> state = base.
    1a3+ ion qubits hold their state. The model is
    described in Hidary and built examples are described
    onlline.
    1a4-. arbitrary single qubit rotations are not
    "a unitary operator for two qubits at once."
    In practice, the CZ flip is a challenge.
    1a5. "measured in the Z basis" would seem to be sufficient.
    In practice, measuring one qubit decoheres its neighbors,
    so they are all measured at once.

    On the topic of rotations in trapped-ion systems:

    https://www.itp.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/a3233/upload/SS16/PQC/PQC_LectureNotes.pdf
        (not yet something I can yet digest)
    indicates that unitary two-qubit operators are made:
        "Build a Hadamard gate with pulses of the type R (θ, φ)."
        "Show that R− (π, 0) corresponds to a SWAP gate when only considering the lowest two states of the vibrational manifold."
        where Hadamard and Swap are definitely 2-qubit gates.
        and the section "Single qubit and CNOT gates are universal"
        is designed to show that the realized gates are universal.

        There exist several protocols for two-qubit gates.
        "The Cirac-Zoller phase gate
        requires an additional electronic state in the second ion
        as an auxiliary state |aux⟩. The implementation consists of
        chaining the three pulses..."

    Rotating trapped ions might mean to mean "physical rotation"
    not rotation on the Bloch sphere??
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02440

    Qubit rotation seems to be on the Block sphere:
        "The term "rotation" alludes to the Bloch sphere representation of a qubit pure state. Gate fidelity can be greater than 99%."
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer#Two_qubit_entangling_gates

        On wiki, "Two qubit entangling gates" seem to be harder than rotation; the CZ gate and more robust variants are proposed.
            "but gates in this impulsive regime (faster than 1 microsecond) have not yet been demonstrated experimentally."

    On measurement:
        https://www.nap.edu/read/25196/chapter/12#199
        Qubit measurement is carried out by “state-dependent fluorescence,” where the ion is illuminated with a laser beam that causes only one of the two possible output states to scatter photons repeatedly, which can be measured with an optical detector. The presence or absence of scattered photons indicates which state the qubit is in. High-fidelity qubit state preparation and detection have been demonstrated for both optical (with error rates, or probabilities, of ~10–4)[23] and hyperfine qubits (with error rates of ~10–3) [24,25]. While reliable measurement is possible, as of 2018, the process affects other qubits in the region where the qubit is being measured, and can leave the measured qubit in an excited state. So current systems measure all qubits at the same time, and they need to be “cooled” before being used again.


1b. A system of 5 thousand qubits that can
find the ground state but
the individual qubits are not adressable.

    Divicenzo: 1. scalable, 2. base state, 3. hold state, 4. sufficient operators, 5. measurement.

    "Bulk" computation is an interesting paradigm, not trivially satisfying Divicenzo's
    requirement that the operators include rotation of a single qubit and measurement of a single qubit.
    You can't draw circuit diagrams indicating what happens to an individual qubit if you can't address them individually.
    Bulk operators don't include operators to rotate one qubit.
    Bulk qubits seem to not be accessible for individual measurement.


    "Do we need to address each and every signel qubit in a device? No!"
        http://qserver.usc.edu/qec11/slides/Twamley_QEC11.pdf
    "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287859263.pdf"

    The system seems scalable, can be set to a base state; operators and state permanence are not disccussed. Measurement
    Divicenzo's "strong measurement" requirement as recorded in Hidary wants to reference "a qubit".

    Is "bulk measurement" or "measurement of some qubits" sufficient for computation?
    What about non-specific implementation of operators? "everyone spin right"?s

2p1. If we are operating on 3-vectors, why do we use 2x2 matrices?
    How is it that a state vector can be represented as a point on a sphere S^2 in R^3?

    The Bloch sphere represents the state of one qubit, with 0 and 1 as the antipodes,
    where they would be if the qubit's states 0 and 1 represented spin-up and spin-down.

    2x2 complex matrices are C^2 , isomorphic to R^4.

    The "equal" or "balanced" superpositions of those states are S^1, a circle,
    the set of complex a*s0 + b*s1 where a and b are complex and each has
    absolute value sqrt(2).
    The Bloch sphere is modulo a complex multiple of state. I.e,
    if t = 1/sqrt(2) then t timese these states are different points on the Bloch sphere:
    s1 + s2, s1 + i*s2, s1 - s2, s1 - i*s2, where we have made the simplifying
    convention that the coefficient of s1 is 1.
    Another different point on the equator of the Bloch sphere would be t times:;
    s1 + (1+i)*s2.
    So the BLoch sphere is C^2 modulo complex multiplication by a constant.
    It's not "C^2 but then the coefficients add up to 1".
    "Modulo C" eliminated two degrees of freeedom.
    Lattitude on the sphere indicates
    the amount of spin-up or spin-down (say) in the qubit.
    Longitude indicates a "phase" in the pairing of the two states.

2p3 How does C^2 act on S^2 \subseteq R^3?

    The "sphere" consists of the south pole 0*|0> + 1*|0> and the rest, each point of
    which contains a representation in which the first coefficient is 1
    and the other coefficient is free. So S^2 is the complex plane made a sphere...
    On the other hand, S^2 \ a point is diffeomorphic to the complex plane C^1 and 
    rotations of the sphere correspond to möbius transformations or linear rational 
    functions with complex variables.
    The Möbius transformations are matrices in C^(2x2) for which
    ordinary matrix multiplication corresponds to the concatenation
    of Möbius transformations.

3p1. For the CZ gate, does it matter which qubit is the control and which is the target?

    The matrix treats them the same way.
    CZ doesn't measure the control or target bit.
    If we apply CZ and then a measurement,
    do both the control and target decohere, or
    does one of them maintain its superposition?

    Hidary is quite clear that there is no difference:
    "we can choose either qubit as the control or the target and we will end up with the same result."
    and
    "This is why we can represent the CZ gate with a dot on both circuit wires."
